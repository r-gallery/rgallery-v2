          <p>
            Founded in 2018, the R Gallery has come to life to showcase the
            artistic minds of both established and emerging local artists in the
            contemporary art scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            With its few years of presence, it has already made an impact in the
            Filipino art community which transcends the corners of the gallery
            as each exhibit and in-house artworks promise a transformative
            experience, both in artistic and intellectual sense.
          </p>

          <p>
            In other words, R Gallery is more than just an art space − it’s a
            place where art experiences and creativity are unfolded. We seek to
            amplify Filipino’s sense of artistry in contemporary global contexts
            and local experiences. With this, the Gallery has moved forward to
            developing vigorous educational programs for the local community.
            Its diverse range of contemporary art exhibitions and programs
            reflect the thriving borderless multi-dimensional environments of
            scholarship, artistic expression and the world we lived in.
